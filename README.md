## Brief Introduction

This is an inventory management app for an imaginary store.  It includes all of the CRUD methods- that is, users are able to create, read, update, and delete data.

## Skills Demonstrated

Skills I've demonstrated and used on this project was ExpressJS, and NodeJS.  In addition, I used the MVC design pattern when building the application.  This project allowed me to fully master my skills in Express.
